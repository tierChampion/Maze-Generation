Maze Generation Project by Thierry Champion
Based on the similar project of Jamis Buck

This project implements 10 different algorithms to generate 'perfect' mazes.
A perfect maze is a maze where you can place a beginning point and an end point and there
will only be one path such that it is the minimum number of steps to get to there. Some of these algorithms also generate a
'minimal spanning tree', which means that if you where to represent the maze as a graph of edges and nodes,
there would be no cycles and there will always be the minimum number of edges to join them.
Others generate 'uniform spanning trees', which means that the graph version of that maze is perfectly random
and doesn't favor a specific behaviour, like short paths or long ones.
